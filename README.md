# Amazon Sales Analysis
This project analyzes Amazon sales data, builds predictive models to forecast order status, and creates an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights. It utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Dash, and Plotly.

## Project Overview

The project aims to provide actionable insights into Amazon sales data through exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and interactive visualization. The steps involved include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and finally, dashboard development for user-friendly data presentation.

## Steps and Methods

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Loading**: Load the raw data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Address missing values in columns like 'currency' and 'Amount'.
- **Data Cleaning**: Convert data types, handle outliers, and ensure consistency in data format.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones based on domain knowledge.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Encode categorical variables for modeling using techniques like label encoder.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute summary statistics to understand data distributions.
- **Visualizations**: Create visualizations (histograms, box plots, etc.) to explore relationships and identify patterns.
- **Insights**: Derive actionable insights from EDA to guide further analysis and modeling decisions.

### 3. Predictive Modeling

- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning models likr Decision Trees.
- **Model Training**: Train models on the preprocessed data using Scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance and generalize well to unseen data.

### 4. Dashboard Development

- **Tools**: Utilize Dash and Plotly to build an interactive web-based dashboard.
- **Components**: Integrate visualizations (line plots, bar charts, etc.) generated from Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly into the dashboard.
- **User Interaction**: Implement filters and dropdowns to allow users to interact with data and gain insights dynamically.
